This is the SafePi V2 project. This project was done as part of a California State University, Monterey Bay Computer Science Capstone by Elliot Shabram, Joseph Carey, Tomas Diaz Wahl, and Liam Cristescu. The original project can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Twilliams073/SafePiGeneral). Note that none of the original code or libraries were used for this project. The only part inherited from the previous project was the SafePi name.
